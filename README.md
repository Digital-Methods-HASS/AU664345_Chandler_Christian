For W48: Web scraping, text mining and mapping with R.

Create Interactive Maps in R Following the Leaflet tutorial, develop a mini-project where you harvest or create digital data of your own, and plot these in an interactive map.

Please see the files: Sarahs_life.R and Sarahs_FavoritePlacesDM2021.

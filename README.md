For W48: Web scraping, text mining and mapping with R.

Create Interactive Maps in R Following the Leaflet tutorial, develop a mini-project where you harvest or create digital data of your own, and plot these in an interactive map.

Please see the files: Sarahs_life.R and Sarahs_FavoritePlacesDM2021.


For the Digital Methods Final Project feel free to look at the various versions of the homemade dataset and the attempts at visualisation in R, which sadly didn't to much nor got very far.
